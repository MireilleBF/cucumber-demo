# cucumber-demo
cucumber demonstration on a very simplified example of store management.

Take the [demonstration developped by Philippe Collet](https://github.com/collet/cucumber-demo) and apply it to another example.

- Cucumber 7 et JUnit 5
- Maven compatible
- JDK 17
- Gherkin and stepDefs FR and EN (integrate _Examples_)
- Github Actions (See in .github/workflows) to simply make a maven+test compilation

The branch _failure_on_CI_ shows tests that do not pass.
